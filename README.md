# Fashion Classification

This case study is very helpful for the recommendation system and also much beneficial for Fashion, Retail, and E-Commerce industry to suggest more content or products to their customer and improve their customer experience.

Here, I have a training set consists of 70,000 sample images of Fashion Products. Dataset sample consists of a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 Product Categories are as follows:
<br>

<img src='0.png' width='175px'><img src='1.png' width='175px'><img src='2.png' width='175px'><img src='3.png' width='175px'><img src='4.png' width='175px'><img src='5.png' width='175px'><img src='6.png' width='175px'><img src='7.png' width='175px'><img src='8.png' width='175px'><img src='9.png' width='175px'>

<br>
In this case study, I assume that the Ecommerce Platform or the Retail Shop of fashion products has 60,000 products from above Product Category. I trained my model to predict the Product Category of 10,000 products used by the customers in the past. So, we can recommend similar products of their choice to them.

<b>Test Accuracy : 92</b>

<br>
I tried 32 filters first. Then 64 filters with and without a dropout of 0.25 to improve the performance of my model (CNN - used TensorFlow backend for Keras). 
<br>
<br>
The test Accuracy of my modal is raised from around 90% to 92%.
